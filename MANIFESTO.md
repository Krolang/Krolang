# MY BELIEFS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

## Privacy is *your* right.
It protects you from bad actors.
But it is under attack.
Let's fix that.

## the Internet should be free.
Today's web has been reduced to a consumerist wasteland.
The elite have centralized it, purged its once unique culture.
Let's take back the net.

## We stand together or Die alone.
The only upper hand we have is solidarity.
We cannot change things alone.
My code will be free for all to use.
